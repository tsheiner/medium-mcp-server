# Session Notes - Medium MCP Server Development

## Current Project Status
- Project structure initialized
- Python environment set up with required packages installed via `requirements.txt`:
  - beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
  - fastapi==0.103.0
  - uvicorn==0.23.2
  - python-dotenv==1.0.0
  - pytest==7.4.0

## Key Decisions Made
- Chose Python over TypeScript for implementation (user has Python familiarity)
- Medium archive location changed from `export/` to `data/` directory
- Claude Desktop is installed and ready for MCP integration

## Next Steps Under Discussion
We were in the process of validating the planned MCP tools against project goals. Key questions raised:
1. Understanding typical brainstorming session workflow
2. Clarifying primary use case (discovery vs analysis vs idea generation)
3. Defining scope of topic suggestion functionality
4. Determining importance of image access/analysis
5. Evaluating if tools sufficiently support content idea generation

## Ready To Continue With
1. Complete tool validation discussion
2. Begin implementing core MCP server functionality
3. Set up article parsing and indexing system

## Open Questions
- Need to clarify specific brainstorming workflow
- Validate if current tool set matches actual usage needs
- Determine importance of image handling in tools
