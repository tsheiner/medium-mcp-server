# MCP Server Debug Report

## Context
I'm debugging a Medium Book MCP server that manages a collection of essays/chapters. The user wants to access two specific draft essays ("Making Predictions" and "Uncertainty Display Standards") to combine them into a single piece about introducing uncertainty concepts to designers.

## Current MCP Server Functions
The server provides these functions:
- `analyze_chapter_completeness` - Shows completion status of all chapters
- `get_chapter_content` - Get full content of a specific chapter
- `find_related_chapters` - Find chapters with similar themes
- `extract_design_philosophy` - Extract core design concepts across chapters
- `identify_content_overlaps` - Find redundant/complementary material
- `suggest_book_structure` - Analyze potential chapter sequences

## Critical Issue: Content Retrieval Completely Broken

**UPDATE AFTER SERVER RESTART**: MCP server is confirmed running (analyze_chapter_completeness works), but content retrieval still completely broken.

### ✅ Working Functions
- `analyze_chapter_completeness` - Works perfectly, returns complete chapter listing
- `suggest_book_structure` - Works perfectly, organizes chapters conceptually  
- `extract_design_philosophy` - Works perfectly, analyzes themes across chapters

### ❌ Still Broken After Server Restart
- `get_chapter_content` - **COMPLETELY BROKEN** - Returns "Chapter '[ID]' not found" for ALL tested IDs
- `find_related_chapters` - **SEARCH BROKEN** - Returns "No related chapters found" for obvious matches  
- `identify_content_overlaps` - **VALIDATION BROKEN** - "Not enough valid chapters found" error

**Key Finding**: Server connectivity is NOT the issue. The problem is specifically with content retrieval and search functionality.

## Specific Test Results

### Chapter Listing (WORKS)
```
analyze_chapter_completeness() returns:

Finished Chapters (18):
- Managing the High Throughput Design Studio (6032 words)
- Understanding Data (4115 words)
- Metric Display Standards (2311 words)
[... full list available]

Draft Chapters (24):
- Making Predictions (2185 words)
- Uncertainty Display Standards (697 words)
[... full list available]
```

### Content Retrieval (ALL FAIL)
Every single attempt to get chapter content fails:

```
get_chapter_content("Making Predictions") → Error: Chapter 'Making Predictions' not found
get_chapter_content("making-predictions") → Error: Chapter 'making-predictions' not found
get_chapter_content("making_predictions") → Error: Chapter 'making_predictions' not found
get_chapter_content("Understanding Data") → Error: Chapter 'Understanding Data' not found
get_chapter_content("understanding-data") → Error: Chapter 'understanding-data' not found
get_chapter_content("Metric Display Standards") → Error: Chapter 'Metric Display Standards' not found
```

### Search Functionality (ALL FAIL)
```
find_related_chapters(theme: "predictions uncertainty AI") → No related chapters found
find_related_chapters(theme: "making predictions") → No related chapters found  
find_related_chapters(theme: "display standards metrics") → No related chapters found
```

This should obviously find "Making Predictions" and "Uncertainty Display Standards" but returns nothing.

### Content Analysis (FAILS)
```
identify_content_overlaps(["Making Predictions", "Uncertainty Display Standards"]) → 
Error: "Not enough valid chapters found"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The fundamental issue appears to be a **complete disconnect between the chapter listing system and the content retrieval system**:

1. **Metadata System Works**: The server can list all chapters with titles, word counts, and status
2. **Content System Broken**: The server cannot retrieve actual chapter content using any variation of the chapter names
3. **Search Index Missing**: The search functionality suggests no indexing of chapter content or themes

## Likely Technical Issues

### Issue 1: ID Mapping Problem
The display names from `analyze_chapter_completeness` are not the actual database/file IDs used by `get_chapter_content`. There's likely a mapping layer that's broken or missing.

### Issue 2: File System Access
The chapter content might be stored in files that the `get_chapter_content` function cannot access due to:
- Incorrect file paths
- Permission issues  
- Missing file system mounting
- Broken slug/ID generation

### Issue 3: Search Index Not Built
The `find_related_chapters` function suggests there's no search index of chapter content, themes, or even basic title matching.

## Questions for Debugging

1. **Storage Format**: How are chapters actually stored? (Database, files, etc.)
2. **ID Generation**: How are chapter IDs generated from titles? Is there a slug conversion?
3. **File Access**: Can the MCP server actually read the chapter content files?
4. **Search Implementation**: Is there supposed to be a search index? Is it built/populated?
5. **Draft vs Finished**: Are draft and finished chapters stored differently?

## Expected Behavior vs Actual

**Expected**: User should be able to access "Making Predictions" and "Uncertainty Display Standards" content to analyze and combine them.

**Actual**: Complete inability to access any chapter content despite the server knowing all chapters exist.

## Immediate Fix Priority
Fix `get_chapter_content` function - this is the core functionality needed. The search features are secondary to just being able to retrieve chapter content by ID.
